# php-white-box-eastern-adventures-hireling
The ‘White Box: Eastern Adventures’ Hireling Generator is designed with PHP to randomly generate a list of 10 hirelings.  Five drop down menus appear on the Launch Page, providing the user with options for customizing the hirelings generated.  POST methods are used to collect the data from the drop down menus, where the data is sent to hirelings.php.  Wherever possible, external PHP files have been created to store related functions; thus, aiming to create a program with high cohesion and low coupling, an important principle of object-orientated design.
